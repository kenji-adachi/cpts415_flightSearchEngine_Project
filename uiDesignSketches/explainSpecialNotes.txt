Special Note Descriptions For UI Design Sketch Images:



*** Trip Search Page ***
Destination could be nothing as one task states: 'Find all the cities reachable within d hops of a city (bounded 
reachability)'

This means that there is only a source needed. 
The Destination can: 
-be left empty or filled and just be ignored
-Give option 'Any' or 'All'

For the info section of trips:
We have to decide what is being displayed in the output table/list
-Should we have a double click option on a particular row to open a pop-up details?
-Should all information be presented in columns?
-etc...



*** Fact Page ***
For this page it includes:
' â€¢ Airline aggregation: 
  - Which country (or) territory has the highest number of Airports 
  - Top K cities with most incoming/outgoing airlines                '
From the project page on canvas.

-Should there be more facts?
-Will it be a check box and a display?
-Straight up display text/label of the facts?
-Can these just be implimented as a 'sorting' function when disaplying in airline/airport searches? (instead of facts page)
